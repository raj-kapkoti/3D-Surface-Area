# 3D-Surface-Area
A 2D board A of size H x W with H rows and W columns.
The board is divided into cells of size 1x1 with each cell indicated by it's coordinate (i,j).
The cell (i,j) has an integer Aij  written on it.
To create the solid the cells are stacked ( Aij numbers of cubes of size 1x1x1 on cell(i,j).
find the total surface area of the solid.
